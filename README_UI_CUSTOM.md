# Bima UI Customizations Summary

This document outlines the recent modifications implemented across the Bima UI to enhance user experience and streamline content presentation.

## Key Changes:

*   **Layout Simplification:**
    *   **Sidebars & Navigation:** The `AppBottomNav`, `AppSidebar`, `AppNav` (side navigation), and the right-hand `app-placeholder-sidebar` have been commented out from `Layout/App.vue` for a cleaner interface.
    *   **Top Navigation:** The `AppTopnav` remains active. 'Home' and 'Explore' links are now consistently visible in the `AppTopnav` for 'My' routes, and a direct 'Home' link has been added to the `AppTopnav` when browsing individual space pages (e.g., Space Overview).

*   **Content Centering & Width Control:**
    *   The main content containers for `Home.vue`, `Landing/Users.vue`, `Space/Proposals.vue`, `Space/Overview.vue`, and `Space/Leaderboard.vue` have been adjusted to occupy `80%` of the screen width and are horizontally centered using `w-4/5 mx-auto` Tailwind classes.

*   **Explore Page Filtering:**
    *   The `Explore.vue` view has been modified to exclusively display the `bima.eth` space in its results.

These updates aim to provide a more focused, intuitive, and consistent user interface, particularly for the Bima DAO governance elements.
